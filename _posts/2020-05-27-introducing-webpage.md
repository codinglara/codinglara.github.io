title: Hello world!

From the first time I learnt about GitHub Pages and its ability to host a fully-customizable public website, I have wanted to create one for myself.

At the moment I have an existing Google Site at [codinglara](https://sites.google.com/view/harshlara). I will not be retiring the website completely. It will be updated, albeit less frequently than this one.

#### So why did I create another website?

I have maintained my Google Site for over 4 years now. I found it to be very functional to use with an easy drag-and-drop user interface. The initial plan was to build a blog using [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=2), where I can write about my ideas - and to host my professional profile on the Google Site itself.

However, after using Blogger for a few posts, I quickly realized that it would not be able to scale to functionality I desired. Blogger is very efficient in its WYSIWYG (*What you see is what you get*) format. But it's also a bit too simple - and that's where it gets constrained.

Enter [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)!

Markdown is so much more customizable than a WYSIWYG editor, that it is easy to fall in love with it. It almost feels like the most natural way of editing text.

What if there was a way to host my personal website and a blog on a platform where I provide content in Markdown...? Enter [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)! 

What is an efficient framework that provides built-in support for GitHub Pages...? Enter [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)!

What is a great minimalistic theme that runs on Jekyll...? Enter [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)!

And that's why it became essential to create another website. To try out this cool ecosystem that I had discovered (very late) on my quest for Markdown support!

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
